The intersection of blockchain and federated learning has inspired numerous architectures aimed at decentralized coordination and security. Early works such as DeepChain~\cite{weng2021deepchain} and Biscotti~\cite{shayan2021biscotti} focused on privacy-preserving aggregation and auditability using differential privacy and cryptographic commitments. Algorand~\cite{gilad2017algorand} demonstrated the efficiency of committee-based sortition for large-scale consensus, a principle adopted by later BCFL systems to mitigate the $O(N^2)$ complexity of PBFT~\cite{castro1999practical}.

Current state-of-the-art committee architectures like BlockDFL~\cite{qin2024blockdfl} and FLCoin~\cite{ren2024scalable} utilize stake-weighted election to select validators. While these systems achieve significant communication reduction—up to 90\% in some deployments~\cite{ren2024scalable}—they remain vulnerable to governance capture if the committee becomes compromised. Traditional defense mechanisms such as Krum~\cite{blanchard2017machine} and Trimmed Mean~\cite{yin2018byzantine} are typically executed by the committee itself; thus, they provide no protection against internal committee collusion. Recent proposals like FedBlock~\cite{nguyen2024fedblock} introduce adaptive committee selection but do not address the long-term stake dynamics that enable Progressive Committee Capture Attacks (PCCA). OUR work addresses this gap by combining optimistic committee execution with a decentralized, incentive-compatible auditing layer.
